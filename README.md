# deps [![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/dropseed/deps.svg)](https://github.com/dropseed/deps/releases)

Deps is a command line tool for managing dependencies that can run locally and in CI.

This repo contains the code for the `deps` command line tool itself (written in Go),
but each language/ecosystem has it's own repo which often uses the native language and acts as a light wrapper around the native dependency management tools.
This way deps can automate updates using the same tools that you would use in your terminal.
